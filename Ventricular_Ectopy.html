            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Ventricular ectopy refers to premature contractions that originate in the ventricles of the heart, leading to early beats that can feel like skipped heartbeats or palpitations. The most common form of ventricular ectopy is Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs), which are extra beats arising from the ventricles. These can occur due to various causes, including ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, electrolyte imbalances, stimulants like caffeine and nicotine, stress, and structural heart defects. While many individuals with ventricular ectopy remain asymptomatic, some may experience dizziness, chest discomfort, or fatigue. Diagnosis typically involves an electrocardiogram (ECG), which shows wide, bizarre QRS complexes that are not preceded by a P wave. In cases where symptoms are significant or the ectopy is frequent, treatment options may include lifestyle modifications, medications such as beta-blockers or antiarrhythmics, and in severe instances, catheter ablation. Generally, isolated PVCs in a healthy heart are considered benign, but when occurring in the context of existing heart disease, they may indicate an increased risk of more serious arrhythmias, necessitating careful evaluation and management.
