            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Hyperkalemia is a medical condition characterized by elevated levels of potassium in the blood, typically defined as a serum potassium level greater than 5.0 mEq/L. Potassium is an essential electrolyte that plays a critical role in maintaining normal cell function, muscle contraction, and nerve transmission. While the body regulates potassium levels through the kidneys, various factors can lead to hyperkalemia, including kidney dysfunction, excessive potassium intake, certain medications (such as ACE inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics), and conditions that cause cell breakdown, like rhabdomyolysis or hemolysis. Symptoms of hyperkalemia can range from mild to severe and may include muscle weakness, fatigue, palpitations, and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications, which may involve dietary changes, medications to lower potassium levels, or dialysis in severe cases.

                    <li>
                        Limit Potassium Intake: Avoid high-potassium foods such as bananas, oranges, potatoes, spinach, and tomatoes. Consult with a nutritionist for tailored dietary guidance.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Review Medications: Regularly review all medications with a healthcare provider, particularly those that can elevate potassium levels (e.g., ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics).
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Regular Testing: Keep track of kidney function through routine blood tests to assess potassium levels and overall renal health, especially for patients with existing kidney conditions.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Stay Hydrated: Adequate hydration supports kidney function and helps with potassium excretion. Consult a healthcare provider about appropriate fluid intake.

                        Discontinue Supplements: Avoid potassium-containing supplements unless prescribed by a healthcare provider, as they can exacerbate hyperkalemia.

                    <li>
                        Recognize Early Signs: Be vigilant for symptoms of hyperkalemia, such as muscle weakness, palpitations, or unusual fatigue, and seek medical attention if they occur.
