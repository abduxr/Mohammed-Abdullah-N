        <p>Bundle Branch Block (BBB) is a condition where there's a delay or obstruction in the electrical conduction within the heart's
        ventricles, specifically affecting the bundle branches, and is detected on an ECG by characteristic changes in the QRS complex.
        In <b>Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB)</b>, the right ventricle depolarizes late, leading to a widened QRS (>120 ms), an RSR "rabbit ears"
        pattern in leads V1 and V2, slurred S waves in leads I, V5, and V6, and sometimes T-wave inversions. In <b>Left Bundle Branch Block 
        (LBBB)</b>,the left ventricle depolarizes late, causing a broad or notched R wave in leads I, V5, and V6, a prolonged QRS (>120 ms), 
        absent Q waves in certain leads, deep  S waves in V1 and V2, and discordant T-wave inversions. RBBB can be benign but may also be 
        linked to conditions like <b>Pulmonory Embolism or Chronic lung disease</b>, while LBBB is more concerning, often associated with serious heart
        conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, or hypertension.<b>Symptoms, if present, include dizziness, fainting, or 
        palpitations, and treatment focuses on managing underlying conditions, with pacemaker implantation considered in severe cases.</b> </p>
