            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition characterized by the progressive dilation and weakening of the heart's ventricles, particularly the left ventricle, which impairs the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. This leads to a decrease in cardiac output and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and fluid retention. The exact cause of DCM can vary; it may be idiopathic or related to factors such as genetic predispositions, viral infections, prolonged alcohol abuse, and certain medications. As the heart enlarges, it can also cause disruptions in the electrical conduction system, often leading to arrhythmias. Diagnosis typically involves echocardiography, ECG, and sometimes cardiac MRI. Management strategies may include lifestyle changes, medications like ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, and in some cases, surgical interventions such as implantable devices or heart transplantation. Early detection and treatment are crucial to improve outcomes and quality of life for affected individuals.
